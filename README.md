## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This project was created to explore some of the simple features of Tkinter. This was my first experience using Tkinter so I decided to create a game everyone knows and loves.

Here's how it works:

* Select either rock, paper or scissors by clicking on the buttons.
* The computer will then select it's choice randomly.
* Comparing the result, the program will display a message on the result of that game.
* To play again just click a button.

Have fun and enjoy the game. :smile:
